            <h3>Problem Description</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The general topic that I will be addressing is the topic of music and our individual personal
                    connections with it.</li>
                <li> The main information technology problem in this space, which I have personally found throughout my
                    years using the best-selling music streaming application Spotify, is that it is difficult to
                    automatically curate playlists based on your own library. By curation, I mean being able to create
                    playlists using songs that you have already liked / added to you playlist / and thus enjoy. This
                    missing functionality was most apparent to me while on a long car ride where I had over 900 songs in
                    an
                    electronic music playlist, but I really wanted to just play a subset of that large playlist -
                    softer,
                    relaxed songs by a specific artist. Because there was no quick, automated way of doing this, I had
                    to
                    queue up songs by manually picking each one out.</li>
                <li>With the current functionality of Spotify, there is plentiful array of options to suggest you
                    Spotify-curated playlists, suggest you new songs based on your older songs, but there really is no
                    great
                    automated way of creating playlists using the songs you already know for sure you like. Taking a
                    look at
                    <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/discover/">other user-created 3rd-party applications that
                        utilize
                        the Spotify Web API</a>, I was unable to find any
                    other applications that strive to automate playlist creation using your own music, so I
                    believe
                    that
                    my application will fill this niche.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Proposed Application</h3>
            <div>
                <h4>App Description</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The users of the application is intended for people currently using the Spotify music streaming
                        service already, because the web app will be collecting data from the user’s Spotify account
                        through
                        the <a
                            href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference-beta/#objects-index">Spotify
                            Web API</a> and also creating and modifying playlists directly to their Spotify account.
                        More specifically, the web app is geared towards users who already have a decent number of
                        playlists
                        and songs added to their own library and would like to create smaller playlists that are subsets
                        or
                        combinations of these playlists.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users will primarily use the web app to create these playlists when they would like to play a
                        particular subset of their enjoyed songs. For example, a user may have 1000 songs in their
                        library
                        that range across a dozen different genres, tempo’s, volume’s, and moods. At a dinner party, the
                        user may want to play just a selection of these 1000 songs, particularly those that are
                        acoustic,
                        soft, and at a slower tempo, for example.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using this web application will solve the problem of having to manually curate your playlists by
                        automating this process. It will do this by taking in certain user input such as what artists
                        they
                        want in the new playlist, what genres, acoustic level, loudness, danceability, and more.

                    <li>
                        On the Spotify authorization login screen, the user inputs username and password to their
                        Spotify
